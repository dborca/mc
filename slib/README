This is the GLib library, version 2.22.2.  It has been radically
stripped down to remove functions that are either unused by the Midnight
Commander or were too heavy for their purpose here.  The complete
distribution can be downloaded from:

http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/glib/2.22/

The sources in this directory are only used if you request to use these
sources by specifying the option `--with-glib0' to the `configure'
script.
