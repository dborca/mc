This directory contains m4 macro files for GNU Midnight Commander.

None of those files is maintained here!
Don't change those files unless:

1) you are upgrading them from the latest version of the package where
they are maintained

OR

2) the fix is needed right now AND this fix has been submitted to the
proper maintainer.

Otherwise, your changes will be lost.
